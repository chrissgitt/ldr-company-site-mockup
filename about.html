                <p class="p-font"> Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, 
                    is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, poet, model, and music video director. 
                    Her music has been noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality; its preoccupation 
                    with themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia; and its references to pop culture,
                    particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.

                <p class="p-font"> Raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey moved to New York City in 2005 to embark on her music 
                    career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased Sirens, 
                    Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her debut single "Video Games" in 2011. 
                    She then signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major-label debut Born to Die 
                    (2012) proved an international success and spawned her first top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 
                    100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of "Summertime Sadness".

                    Del Rey released the Grammy-nominated EP, Paradise (2012), to further positive reviews. In 2013, 
                    Del Rey ventured into the film as she wrote, directed, and starred in the short music film, Tropico 
                    (2013), and released "Young and Beautiful", the theme for The Great Gatsby (2013). Del Rey 
                    subsequently issued her sophomore major-label effort, Ultraviolence (2014), to similar success as it 
                    topped the charts and spawned the hit single, "West Coast". That same year, Del Rey recorded the 
                    eponymous theme for Big Eyes (2014), which garnered her both a Grammy and Golden Globe nomination. 
                    Since then, Del Rey has released Honeymoon (2015) and Lust for Life (2017), the latter of which topped 
                    the charts in numerous countries and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

                    Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, was released on August 30, 2019. Her first 
                    poetry book, titled Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass was released on September 29, 2020, 
                    accompanied by an audiobook. Del Rey would go on to release two albums in 2021, Chemtrails over the 
                    Country Club and Blue Banisters. After a one-year break, Del Rey released her ninth studio album, 
                    Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, on March 24, 2023.
